<h3>SwiftUI</h3>
<p class="bodyText"> SwiftUI is the modern way to build great-looking user interfaces across all Apple platforms. You 
can learn it once and apply it everywhere. This year, SwiftUI is more powerful, flexible, and easier to adopt. 
Take control of your app’s navigation with a new stateful navigation API, build the layout that works best for 
your app with all-new custom layouts, and use SwiftUI more seamlessly in UIKit apps with new UICollectionView 
custom cell support.</p>

<p class="bodyText">In an update to iOS 16 later this year, you'll be able to create Live Activities with WidgetKit to help people
stay on top of what’s happening in your app in real time, right from the Lock Screen. And with SwiftUI, you 
can animate your Live Activities from one state to the next.</p>

<h3>Machine learning</h3>
<h4>Core ML</h4>
<p class="bodyText">Use Xcode 14 to analyze and optimize your Core-ML-powered features. Generate performance
reports for Core ML models on your Mac or any connected iOS device without having to write any code. Review a 
summary of load and prediction times along with a breakdown of compute unit usage. Profile your app to view Core
ML API calls and associated models using the Core ML template in Instruments. Combine information from the Core ML,
Neural Engine, and GPU Instruments to track when and where models are executed on accelerated hardware. Aggregate
timing data is summarized for each event, model, and submodel.</p>
<p class="bodyText">The Core ML framework now supports Float16 input and output feature types. This, combined
with APIs for supplying your own output buffer backings for predictions, enables more control of how efficiently 
data flows in and out of your Core ML models. Support for sparse weight compression, restricting compute to the 
CPU and Neural Engine, and in-memory model instantiation are also now available.</p>

<h4>Create ML app</h4>
<p class="bodyText">Interactively learn about your model’s accuracy in the new evaluation UI in the Create ML
app. Explore key metrics and their connections to specific examples to help identify challenging use cases and further 
investments in data collection to help improve model quality. Preview your model’s predictions on live video 
from your iPhone camera.</p>

<h4>Create ML framework</h4>
<p class="bodyText">Create ML is now available as a Swift framework on tvOS, along with iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
In addition to task-specific training APIs being available for many common model types, you can now define your 
own custom model and training pipelines by combining a rich set of ML building blocks with the new Create ML 
Components framework.</p>
